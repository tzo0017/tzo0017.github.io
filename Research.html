            <hr>
            <p> <font color='blue'><b>Abstract:</font></b> In this study, we investigate a problem of sampling Gauss-Markov processes. The optimal sampling problem is formulated as a constrained continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) with an uncountable state space. We provide an exact solution to this MDP: The optimal sampling policy is a threshold policy on instantaneous estimation error and the threshold is found. Further, if the sampler has no knowledge of the signal process, the optimal sampling problem reduces to an MDP for minimizing a nonlinear age of information metric. The age-optimal sampling policy is a threshold policy on expected estimation error and the threshold is found. In both problems, the optimal sampling policies can be computed by low-complexity algorithms (e.g., bisection search and Newtonâ€™s method), and the curse of dimensionality is circumvented. These results hold for (i) general service time distributions of the queueing server and (ii) sampling problems both with and without a sampling rate constraint. Numerical results are provided to compare different sampling policies.</p></a>

              <b>Abstract:</font>
              </b> In this study, we consider a sampling and transmission scheduling problem for multi-source remote estimation, where a scheduler determines when to take samples from multiple continuous-time Gauss-Markov processes and send the samples over multiple channels to remote estimators. The sample transmission times are i.i.d. across samples and channels. The objective of the scheduler is to minimize the weighted sum of the time-average expected estimation errors of these Gauss-Markov sources. This problem is a continuous-time Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) problem with a continuous state space. We prove that the bandits are indexable and derive an exact expression of the Whittle index. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first Whittle index policy for multi-source signal-aware remote estimation of Gauss-Markov processes. Our results unite two theoretical frameworks that were used for remote estimation and AoI minimization: threshold-based sampling and Whittle index-based scheduling. In the single-source, single-channel scenario, we demonstrate that the optimal solution to the sampling and scheduling problem can be equivalently expressed as both a threshold-based sampling strategy and a Whittle index-based scheduling policy. Notably, the Whittle index is equal to zero if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the channel is idle, and (ii) the estimation error is precisely equal to the threshold in the threshold-based sampling strategy. Moreover, the methodology employed to derive threshold-based sampling strategies in the single-source, single- channel scenario plays a crucial role in establishing indexability and evaluating the Whittle index in the more intricate multi- source, multi-channel scenario. Our numerical results show that the proposed policy achieves high performance gain over the existing policies when some of the Gauss-Markov processes are highly unstable.</p></a>

            <hr>
            <b>Abstract:</font>
        </b> In this study, we investigate context-aware status
        updating, where a centralized monitor pulls status updates
        from multiple sensors that are monitoring several safety-critical
        situations (e.g., carbon monoxide density in forest fire detection,
        machine safety in industrial automation, road safety). Due
        to transmission errors and limited communication resources,
        status updates may not be timely, resulting in the possibility
        of misunderstanding the current situation. In particular, if a
        dangerous situation is misinterpreted as safe, the safety-risk
        is high. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that
        quantifies the cost of situational unawareness due to potential
        danger. Our framework supports general loss functions and
        we formulate a situation-aware penalty function that depends
        on two key factors: the Age of Information (AoI) and the
        observed signal value. In addition, we provide an information-
        theoretic bound that evaluates the fundamental performance
        limit of situational unawareness cost in safety-critical systems.
        To minimize the penalty, we study a pull-based multi-sensor,
        multi-channel transmission scheduling problem. We show that it
        is beneficial to always keep the servers busy to reduce the overall
        system penalties. Due to communication resource constraints,
        the multi-sensor, multi-channel transmission scheduling problem
        can be modeled as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB). By
        utilizing relaxation and Lagrangian decomposition, we provide
        a low-complexity scheduling algorithm to effectively address the
        RMAB which is asymptotically optimal. Our results hold for both
        reliable and unreliable channels. Numerical evidence shows that
        our multi-sensor, multi-channel scheduling policy can achieve up
        to 100 times performance gain over periodic updating and up to
            10 times over randomized policy.</p></a>
